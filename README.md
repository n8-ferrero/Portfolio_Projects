1: BASIC_BANKING_APP: Class project that displays a basic "ATM" menu, allows a users to login with name and pin input validation, displays the current balance, allows a user to depost, withdraw (with balance validation), and log out of the app. 

2: DONATIONS_TRACKER: Class project that displays a basic menu, allows a user to login or register, allows donations if the user is properly logged in, and tracks/displays donations that have been made. 

3: HANGMAN_GAME: This is your classic hangman game. It will display how many letter are present in the word, as well as the gallows, and the graphics are updated to show correct and incorrect guesses. It will display the word at the end of the game (win or lose).

4: BATTLEGAME: This was the first large program that I wrote. It is a simple "battle" game that is pre-scripted. You select your class, and the game has you fight a dragon. I would like to improve this code with classes, random damage output for the characters and the dragon, and possibly random encouter modifiers that would really alter the course of the battle. I would also like to implement a feature that asks if you want to keep fighting or try to evade and escape that also relies on randomizing variables to determine if you are successful in your escape. 

5: CC_DICEGAME: This is a simple dice game that chooses a random integer between 1 and 6 for each die, prints those numbers, add them together and stores the high score. This could be improved with a versus mode against a computer player, and the object to be who rolls closest to a randomized number between 2 and 12, while tracking the updated score for each player. 

6: FIZZBUZZ: standard python challenge code to check if a number is divisible (no remainder) by 3, 5, or both. Displays Fizz if divisible by 3, Buss if divisible by 5, and FizzBuzz if divisible by both. 

7: PASSWORD_GEN: This will generate a random password between 12 and 16 characters long, and include lowercase, special characters, and numbers. It will then display the password for the user.

8: PAY_ROULETTE: This code will choose a random name from a provided list of names. This name is the lucky, or possibly unlucky person that gets to pay for the meal. Can be used for any group activity that needs a randomized choice on who gets to pay.

9: TIP_CALCULATOR: Very useful code that will calculate the total bill (bill with tip included) based on a tip percentage that you would like to leave. It will then ask how many people there are to split the bill between, and display that amount for each person to pay.
